# Employee Attrition Prediction
#### Prediction of Employee Attrition using Machine Learning and Deep learning

Employee attrition is a significant challenge for organizations, affecting stability, performance, and productivity. High turnover leads to the loss of valuable talent and expertise, incurs substantial costs for recruitment and training, and often results in reduced productivity. To address this issue proactively, leveraging HR analytics and predictive modeling with machine learning has become crucial.

This project aims to apply advanced machine learning techniques to analyze HR data and predict employee attrition accurately. By understanding the factors contributing to attrition, organizations can make informed, data-driven decisions to enhance employee engagement and reduce turnover. This study illustrates the effectiveness of predictive analytics in transforming talent management from a reactive to a proactive approach.

##### Problem Statement
XYZ Company faces a 15% annual attrition rate. This results in:

Delays in ongoing projects,
High costs for hiring and training new staff,
Reduced productivity as new employees ramp up.
The objective is to model and predict employee attrition, enabling the company to make informed decisions to reduce turnover.
